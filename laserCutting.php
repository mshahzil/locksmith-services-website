          <p>A laser cut key is designed in a unique way, they are made with constant depth down the middle, making them thicker and more sturdy than a traditional key.
            Also, there are fewer grooves on a laser cut key, and this design element affects how the key rotates in a locking cylinder.
            Many laser-cut keys are constructed with a transponder chip, which has to be programmed by professional. The transponder component is an important feature that boosts security.
